# Overview

This area covers a wide range of technologies that could be considered alternative displays compared to the standard ones. They are often niche products or artistic approaches. As such, many are very expensive when compared to standard ones.&#x20;

After this section, there is a slightly different category of "techniques" that is more of an unusual application of a standard display. There are plenty of crossover ideas between the two, so I wouldn't consider either as a strict line.&#x20;
