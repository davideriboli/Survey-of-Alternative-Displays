There are a few different approaches to this technology, but one form of it uses a small element of fiber optics, a light source, and an electromechical method of quickly vibrating the fiber optic point of light in front of a lens array so that persistence of vision can create a small scale image in front of someone's eye for the purposes of augmented reality.
