# Electrochromic Paint

Electrochromic Paint is a specialized paint that lights up in a color similar to glow-in-the-dark paint when an electrical current is applied. One of the main providers of the electric paint is [Lumilor](https://www.lumilor.com).&#x20;

There are some restrictions about the amount of surface area (not much larger than 280 square inches for a single lightup sector) that can be lit up with this kind of paint, but for the right application it can be a great fit. Additionally, it doesn't have an infinite lifespan, or its brightness tends to fade over time, so it's not particularly suited for permanent installations.
