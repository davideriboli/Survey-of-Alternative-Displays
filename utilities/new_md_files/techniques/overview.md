# Overview

In this section, we'll cover various light manipulation techniques. In my definition, techniques are a slightly different area than a specific "technology", but it is ultimately a semantic difference. There are some projects mentioned in the previous section that could be considered a technique as well.&#x20;

Typically in the techniques I mention below, you are using something like a standard display but in a non-standard way. You may be using a display and augmenting it with a plastic or cloth material, you may be using a fog machine to create a projection surface instead of a flat wall.&#x20;
