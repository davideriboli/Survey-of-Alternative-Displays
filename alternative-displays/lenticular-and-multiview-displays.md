This is another wide reaching category that could be classified under a few different names. I previously categorized some of these under lightfield displays, but this category tends to use a different approach.



## Looking Glass Factory Displays

[Looking Glass Factory](https://lookingglassfactory.com)

Looking Glass Factory has been a pioneer in lightfield displays for years and has made a number of innovative products in this category. Their differentiator is that a lot of their products are geared towards an average consumer rather than only an expensive commercial market.&#x20;

In very basic, but somewhat unaccurate terms, the display itself uses a very high resolution/high pixel density display and a specialized lenticular film that directs the light into a few dozen different viewing angles. A specialized imaging pipeline takes a 3D scene, slices it up into all of these different views, and puts each one on a thin slice on the display. As that light passes through the lenticular film, it gets refracted into the different angles and allows each of your eyes to see a different view. The effect itself is very convincing and really feels like a floating image is right in front of the display.

Their latest product, the Looking Glass Portrait is a 7.9" lightfield display with a 78ยบ viewing cone an it goes for $399. It's great for small experiments and things like viewing personal portraits.  While it does allow for multiple viewers at the same time, its somewhat small size and narrow viewing cone needs careful consideration if it is to be used for an installation project.

Looking Glass Factory does offer 2 other more commercially oriented versions for large scale displays, but the price point is a large leap. They have a 4K Gen 2 display that is about 15.6" diagonally. Their 8K Gen2 Display is about 32" on the diagonal. As the displays get larger, they need to pack even more pixels into the display to create the same vokumetric visual effect. This creates more and more overhead for rendering as well, but it will be interesting to see where this kind of technology goes as resolution density continues to evolve.

Below is an overview of Looking Glass's previous product that utilzied somewhat similar technology but had a large slab of acrylic on top of the display that felt like a volume that contained the image. The newer version feels like an image you can touch.

### Leia Lightfield Display

Leia Lightfield Displays are another commercially available product in the form of an android tablet that promises a lightfield experience, but ultimately uses a different optical stack than Looking Glass or other light field displays. They use a specialized diffractive backlight technology that essentially delivers different viewing angles to each eye to create a sense of depth. More on the scientific approach in the video below.

Also more writing on the technology itself [here](https://www.leiainc.com/newsroom/leia-brings-3d-lightfield-to-a-monitor-near-you).

Here is a [whitepaper on the technology as well](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11972).

Leia may be working on an updated display from their tablet as well - a sample video of it is featured [here](https://twitter.com/nimazeighami/status/1524853044734664705?s=21).

[Leia also acquired Dimenco in 2023](https://www.leiainc.com/newsroom/leia-inc-acquires-dimenco-unifying-global-leaders-in-3d-display-technology), and they were another autostereoscopic manufacturer with a slightly different approach.

This one is a tricky one for me because its somewhat like a light field display mentioned in the next section, but is treated a bit more like a multiview experience.  [Misapplied Science's Parallel Reality LED display](../experimental-other/other-experiments.md#parallel-reality-display)&#x20;

### Multi Lens Display

These are more in the lab experiment realm, but worth mentioning as a curiosity. This experiment from around 2010 by [Hideki Kakeya](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-20-23-25902\&id=244861) utilizes a display that shows multiple angles of some 3D content and an array of microlenses to provide multiple glasses-free angles of that content.

JDI is a Japanese display company that has a wide range of interesting displays, but most don't seem available to consumers or for small scale purchases - they are primarily geared towards commercial large volume applications. Nonetheless, they do have a wide range of interesting displays that are likely lenticular and not true light fields: [https://www.j-display.com/en/product\_tech/light\_field.html](https://www.j-display.com/en/product\_tech/light\_field.html)
