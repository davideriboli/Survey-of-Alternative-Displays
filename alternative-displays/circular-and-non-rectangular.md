# Circular and Non Rectangular

While these displays might technically fall under the more traditional display types, non-rectangular displays do feel like a bit of a special beast that warrant their own category. Even 1x1 square displays, while rectangular, are still a bit hard to find these days.

### Circular Displays

There aren't a ton of specific providers for these displays for consumer use since the cost and difficulty to produce makes them less likely to be produced in small volumes.&#x20;

Here are a couple resources I've come across for round and rounded edge displays:

* [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/4inch-720x720-lcd.htm) has a number of circular displays at sizes from around 1" to 5" diameter (with a square resolution). Surprisingly reasonable prices of less than $200/unit and just regular HDMI input drivers. They also have a couple displays with rounded edges instead of corners at various small sizes as well. As a bonus, most of these also include touch sensing capabilities as well. I currently see resolution ranges at around 240x240 for the smaller ones and 1080x1080 for the larger ones.
* [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5806?gad\_source=1\&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0\_WyBhDMARIsAL1Vz8slq71Fj3Uk-j\_XULRHS-w-Chq4eUavc1IMBxCMnw-UpkQ8EBZH0e4aApcOEALw\_wcB) also has a a couple circular displays meant to be combined with things like Raspberry Pi's
* [Crystal Display Solutions](https://crystal-display.com/circular-lcd-display-range-from-crystal-displays/) has a range of options for circular as well but no specs on size ranges.
* Some of these smaller displays are not necessarily meant to be driven by an HDMI connection and might need something a little more exotic like an SPI or ribbon connector to a driver.
* SInce the use case for these displays is rare, usually the circular effect is achieved by putting a physical mask overtop of a standard display.

### Non-Rectangular

These are a bit more unusual than circular displays. The only ones I've seen very occasionally are triangular displays, but they aren't produced very often.
