# 2022 Update Notes

**Additions for 2022 compared to the original 2015 version:**

* Moved to github/gitbook
* Re-organized content and added a new outline
* Added new content and examples to almost every content page
* Added separate sections for Legacy, Technique, and Experimental approaches
* Added the following sections compared to the original, and dozens of new examples and videos. Most of the original categories also have many new subcategories within that weren't originally included.
  * Switchable Glass
  * Drone Displays
  * Many new Transparent displays and transparent OLED updates
  * Electrochromic Paint
  * Scanning Fiber Optics
  * Lasers and video projection
  * Laser Diodes
  * Many new Lightfield displays (Looking Glass, Solidlight, Fovi, Leia)
  * Architectural E-Ink
  * Ferrofluid
  * Acoustic Levitation
  * High Refresh Rate Displays
  * Cathode Ray Tube
  * Eggcrate and numerical displays
  * Pyrotechnics and other curiosities
  * Misleading terms
  * Touchscreen notes
  * XR and Virtual Production
  * ...and more?

This is currently using Gitbook's free plan. If there is enough interest, I could set up a tipjar or something for this project and open it up as a paid project with multiple contributors and the ability to export the entire thing as a formatted PDF.
