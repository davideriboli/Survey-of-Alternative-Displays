### Light Leaks

Using standard projectors, an array of mirror balls, a lot of math, and a map of the space, Kyle McDonald and Jonas Jongejan created this piece to create spatialized visuals.

### Wedge Display

The [CamFPD Wedge Display ](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/flat-screen-tv-masses-innovative-wedge-screen-offers-bigger-cheaper-displays)- No updates or news since 2004. Seems to be a similar principle to waveguide displays used for AR headsets by "projecting" light on a flat plane.

### Lickable Display

A [researcher](https://www.reuters.com/technology/lick-it-up-japan-professor-creates-tele-taste-tv-screen-2021-12-23/) has combined a traditional display with an aerosol dispenser to spray a screen with different flavors that can be licked by a user to be able to taste what is on screen. The project is called Taste the TV by researcher Homei Miyashita

### Liquavista Electrowetting Displays

These displays promised an alternative to E-Ink but with a faster refresh rate but never made it to market. [You can read more about them here](https://lookgadgets.com/liquavista/).

### Deconstructed LCD

### Colloidal Bubble Display

This experiment involves using a special coilloidal solution and an ultrasonic speaker that can be used to "tune" the transparency and reflectiveness of a bubble when light is projected on it.&#x20;

### Stacked microLED

Most pixels are arranged as red, green, and blue pixels arranged horizontally side by side. In 2023, MIT unveiled a stacked vertical pixel arrangement that allows them to be stacked on top of eachother for greater horizontal density, an important component of higher resolution headset displays.

### Phases by AV\&C

This piece really strays between lighting element and display for me, but I think it's worth mentioning. It uses an array of mirrors and lights to create controlled reflections around the space - [Phases by Vincent Houze and AV\&C](https://www.av-controls.com/#/phases/)

### Robotics and Displays

There are a few examples out there of displays on robot arms and moving displays. I'd say these are a little different from the mechanical displays in the other section since this is about moving whole units of a display versus moving individual pixel elements.

And while the below project from Bot and Dolly is really a projection mapping example, it really needs to be mentioned in this category.
